## 📖 About  

**Atlas Matrix** is a powerful and user-friendly tool designed to simplify and streamline the process of creating and managing matrix-based constraints in Maya.

It features a clean, tabbed interface that supports:
- Parent constraints with fine control over axes and weights
- Aim constraints with full vector and up-vector configuration
- Manager panel (placeholder for future development)

Atlas Matrix is fully built with **PySide6** and supports Maya 2025’s native Qt6 backend.

## 📁 File Structure

```
atlas_matrix_tool/
├── atlas_matrix_ui.py         # Auto-generated UI (compiled from .ui file via pyside6-uic)
├── atlas_matrix_window.py     # Main QMainWindow logic & UI integration
├── atlas_matrix_launcher.py   # Clean entry point for Maya integration
```

---

## 🚀 Installation

1. Copy the `atlas-matrix/` folder to your Maya scripts directory (e.g. `~/Documents/maya/scripts/`).
2. In Maya’s Script Editor, paste the following Python code:

```python
import sys
import os

# Add the path to your tool (adjust if needed)
tool_path = os.path.expanduser("~/Documents/maya/scripts/atlas-matrix")
if tool_path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(tool_path)

# Reload and launch
import launcher
import importlib
importlib.reload(launcher)

launcher.launch()
```

💡 **Pro Tip**: Assign this code to a custom Maya shelf button for quick access!

## 📖 About  

**Atlas Matrix** is a powerful and user-friendly tool designed to simplify and streamline the process of creating and managing matrix-based constraints in Maya.

It features a clean, tabbed interface that supports:
- Parent constraints with fine control over axes and weights
- Aim constraints with full vector and up-vector configuration (placeholder for future development)
- Remove constraints
- Manager panel (placeholder for future development)

Atlas Matrix is fully built with **PySide6** and supports Maya 2025’s native Qt6 backend. 
Code is adapted to run on **PySide2**
